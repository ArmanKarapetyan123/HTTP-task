# HTTP-task

Sorry i tried a lot to obtain free domain(to obtain a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt) and do the task properly but i 

couldn't find it ,so i tried to do something on localhost.

At first i used OpenSSL to generate a private key and a self-signed certificate (this all are in "certs" dir).

I had such problem - [Google Chrome Developer Tip] Prevent Warning “Your connection is not private” from appearing 

After disabling several options , browser allowed see the picture.
